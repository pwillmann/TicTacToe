# Tic Tac Toe 

Basic TicTacToe Game 100% built with Kotlin.

## About

This App serves as a Demo-Project to get started with Kotlin development and is based on the TicTacToe
App of Hussein Al Rubaye's Udemy Course ["The complete Kotlin developer course"](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-kotlin-developer-course/learn/v4/overview).

Own designs have been added to the [`/design`](https://github.com/pwillmann/TicTacToe/tree/master/design). directory, which are made with Affinity Designer.

VectorDrawableAnimations were created with the amazing [Shapeshifter](https://shapeshifter.design/) tool
by Alex Lockwood.
